  Bruce Wayne: Rebuild it. Just the way it was, brick for brick.

  Alfred Pennyworth: *Just* the way it was, sir?

  Bruce Wayne: Yeah. Why?

  Alfred Pennyworth: I thought this might be a good opportunity for improving the foundations.

  Based upon the principles of continuous integration, pennyworth will
  help you build assets for any software you use and provides a
  reasonable means to distribute it throughout your nodes. By using a
  well tested package management system under the hood for deployment, you can easily roll back versions and manage node
  level conflicts.

  Jenkins can be configured to search for feature branches, for
  advanced workflows. We've included some examples for basic branch tracking.

  Many example data bags are included that show how to test, build and
  package a variety of projects, including Ruby and Clojure projects.

** vagrant support
   - you can use 'vagrant up' to launch a virtualbox instance based on
     Ubuntu Natty 11.04 amd64 to run pennyworth

** chef cookbooks
*** jenkins
    - Based on Fletcher Nichols' [[https://github.com/fnichol/chef-jenkins][chef-jenkins cookbook]]
*** pennyworth
**** recipe: ssh_keys
     - drops keypairs off for Jenkins, so it can talk to your Git infrastructure later.
**** recipe: remount_ephemeral
     - on ec2, remount the ephemeral device (with an appropriate
       filesystem and such) at a convenient location for jenkins
**** recipe: riak
     - in one of our deployments a pennyworth project required riak,
       so we shipped it
**** recipe: default
     - consumes the pennyworth databag items individually, adding them
       to jenkins and so on.
**** recipe: update_version
     - ships the update_version script which updates the "package"
       data bag versions for each job
*** [[http://mirrorer.alioth.debian.org/][reprepro]]
    - reprepro (formerly known as mirrorer) is a nasty old debian tool
      that you can use to manage an APT repository
    - could easily slot something like
      [[https://github.com/rcrowley/freight][Richard Crowley's freight]] project in here
*** apt
    - upstream opscode cookbook, provides apt repository LWRP which is used to
      install the repository hosted on the jenkins node
*** java
    - upstream opscode cookbook, installs java
*** leiningen
    - installs the leiningen build tool for clojure
** data bags
*** package
    - this allows for an API client to query the chef server for
      available versions
    - can be updated at end-of-build by Jenkins (examples included)
*** pennyworth
    - multiple types of jenkins jobs
**** testing
     - Git based, runs test commands
**** packaging
     - Git based, runs test, build and package commands.
     - Examples included for building packages with fpm
     - Packages built with fpm can be included into a Reprepro package
       repository on the system
** other tools
*** [[https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm][fpm]]
   - fpm allows us to build debian packages out of basically anything,
     including cool stuff like ruby gems and python eggs
   - we use it inside of pennyworth jenkins projects to build
     architecture-specific assets of varying types of projects
** knife deploy plugin
   - to be documented
